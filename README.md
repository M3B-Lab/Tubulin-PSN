# Tubulin-PSN
This repository contains all the necessary data to replicate the simulations of the paper "Mechanical Communication within the Microtubule through Network-based Analysis of Tubulin Dynamics", which has been submitted but not published.

The input data to replicate the simulations are organized as follows:
- `md.mdp`: The mdp file used to run the simulations in GROMACS.

- `S1/`: Folder regarding the S1 system.

  - `Input/`: Folder containing the pdb and tpr files.

  - `Topologies/`: Folder containing the topology defining the system.

- `S2/`: Folder regarding the S2 system.

  - `Input/`: Folder containing the pdb and tpr files.

  - `Topologies/`: Folder containing the topology defining the system.

- `S3/`: Folder regarding the S3 system.

  - `Input/`: Folder containing the pdb and tpr files.

  - `Topologies/`: Folder containing the topology defining the system.
