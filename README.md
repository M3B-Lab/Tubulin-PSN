\bullet `md.mdp`

This is the mdp file used to run the simulations in GROMACS.

\bullet `S1`
 This is the folder regarding the S1 system.

  - `Input/`

  folder containing the pdb and tpr files.

  - `Topologies/`

  folder containing the topology defining the system.

\bullet `S2`
 This is the folder regarding the S2 system.

  - `Input/`

  folder containing the pdb and tpr files.

  - `Topologies/`

  folder containing the topology defining the system.

\bullet `S3`
 This is the folder regarding the S3 system.

  - `Input/`

  folder containing the pdb and tpr files.

  - `Topologies/`

  folder containing the topology defining the system.
